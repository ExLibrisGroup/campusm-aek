campusM AEK Example Projects

## Prerequisites
You must be set up with the AEK to run these example projects. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/campusm/npm/gettingstarted/). 

## Installation
1. Clone the campusm-aek repo
2. Go into the folder/project you want to run (each folder is its own AEK project)
3. Run the following 
```bash
aek install
```
4. Enter your login details (you will be prompted for this) 
5. Start the AEK project  
```bash
aek start
```

Once these steps are done, you should see the project running on [http://locahost:5000](http://locahost:5000). 

Corresponding blogs to these projects can be found in the Ex Libris Developer Network [here](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/?search=campusm).
