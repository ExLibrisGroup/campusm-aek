These tools were developed by ExLibris and provide useful utilities and integration points for the AEK and the CampusM platform.\n\n## AEK React\n\nThis package also includes a set of React components that have been explicitly designed to meet common goals of the AEK and integrate well with other libraries and aek-css framework. The use of React is optional but this forms part of our recommended technology stack.\n\n## Client Tools\n\nOur client tools provide integration points between your AEK code and the native host client allowing you to work with native features such as maps and camera functions\n\n## Other\n\nThe package also contains other useful library code for common utilities such as ajax, routing, logging, etc.\n",
