# Installation Details

The following instructions are to get your machine ready for using AEK CLI. This should take no more than 30 minutes for you to get up and running.

Most of the steps are the same for Windows and OSX.

If you do not wish to take these steps on your PC, or you have issues or limitations on your environment, an alternative may be to use an [online cloud IDE](20-cloud-ide).

## App Manager Accounts

An App Manager account is required to use most of the AEK tools. You will need sufficient permissions to create and publish AEK Screens and Menu Options.

As a number of tools are built on npm protocols that require an email address, you must ensure that your App Manager account has an email address associated with it. This can be managed in the User/Permissions section of App Manager.

## Additional software

There are a few software prerequisites that you will need to install before we can get the AEK CLI installed if you don't already have them.

Below are the steps of installing this software.

### Git

Git is not a direct dependency of AEK CLI but it may be required to download third party modules that are only available via git.

Git is available from https://www.git-scm.com

### Node.js

NodeJS provides the Javascript runtime that most are tools run on.

You can download it from here https://nodejs.org/ which provides convenient installers for MacOSX and Windows.

Once installed, you should be able to run `node --version` at the command line.

If this does not work, you may need to take the additional step of adding nodejs to your system path. You can do this with the following steps

`Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables`

Now add the appropriate path to your installation. For example

`C:\apps\nodejs\`


## Preflight check

You should now be able to run the following commands

`git --version`

`node --version` - should return something higher than 0.12.0

`npm --version` - should return something higher than 2.0.0


## Installing aek-cli

Once the above has been done you can enter the following at the command line:

`npm install -g https://npm.campusm.net/get/aek-cli`

This will then download and install AEK CLI globally to your machine.

Once complete you should be able to execute the command `aek` which should return a menu of aek commands.

## Installation Issues

### Issues with Git on Windows

Even with Git installed, you may need to ensure that it has been added to your system path.

To add to your system path..

`Computer -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables`

and add the the appropriate path to PATH. Usually...

`C:\Program Files (86)\Git\bin`

*** Please not that on a windows 32bit machine it will not need the (86) as this is for 64bit versions. Please use the following below ***

`C:\Program Files\Git\bin`

*** Also to not if you installed GIT into a custom directory you will need to replace `Program Files` with the correct directory you installed GIT into.

---------------------------------

Some NPM modules may depend on packages that are GIT resources. The default behavior is to request these using the `git://` protocol (TCP port 9418). Some network environments may refuse connections via this port (this is quite common on university networks). If you encounter this problem you may need to switch to using `https://` instead. This can be done by modifying your GIT config with the following command

```bash
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

### Issues with NodeJS on Windows

On Windows if you are getting an error saying that the command has not be found you may need to edit your PATH settings once again.

`%Current Users%\AppData\Roaming\npm`

Change this to your Windows User for Example

`C:\Users\Simon\AppData\Roaming\npm`

Once this is done try `aek` again and this should now work.
