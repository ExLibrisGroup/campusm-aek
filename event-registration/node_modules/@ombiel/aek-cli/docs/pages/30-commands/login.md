# `aek login`

In order to pull, push, deploy and preview connected screens, you will need to have an established session with App Manager. All AEK commands that require authentication will execute a login automatically so you will rarely need to use this command directly.

Sessions are managed by requesting a token from AppManager. Tokens last 15mins but are renewed on every authenticated command. If you are using a public or shared machine, you should be careful to logout to remove any session tokens.

```bash
aek login
```
