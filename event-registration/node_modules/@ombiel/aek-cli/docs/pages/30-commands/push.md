# `aek push`

This will push the package in your current working directory to the AEK registry. The behaviour is synonomous with `npm publish`.

You are responsible for explicitly defining the package version using `npm version` or manually modifying the `package.json` file. If you try to push a package that matches an existing package and version, you will get a publish conflict.

A push can also be performed as part of a `deploy` process using `aek deploy -n`. This command is available as an alternative, usually used for pushing library code to the registry where no screens or public assets are involved.

A `tag` can be specified. If omitted, the `latest` tag is automatically applied, making the new version the default for future installs.

```bash
aek push
```
Details for usage can be obtained using `aek help push`

```bash
Usage: aek push [options]

Options:
   --username
   --password
   -t, --tag
```
