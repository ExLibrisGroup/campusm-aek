# Stored Address

`storedAddress` is a function. It returns a promise that resolves when the address details are ready. If the address details are unavailable, the promise is rejected.

## Example AEK implementation

``` javascript

var storedAddress = require("@ombiel/aek-lib/client-tools/stored-address");

storedAddress
   .get()
   .then(function(address) {
     alert("Your postcode is " + address.postcode);
   })
   .catch(function(err) {
     alert(err.message);
   });


```
