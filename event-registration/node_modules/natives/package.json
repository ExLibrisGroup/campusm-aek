  "readme": "# natives\n\nDo stuff with Node.js's native JavaScript modules\n\n## Caveat\n\nDear Beloved User,\n\nI feel compelled to give you a word of warning if you are considering\nusing this module.\n\nThis module lets you do some creative things with the JavaScript code\nin Node.js.  There are some things here that are basically a recipe\nfor memory leaks, or at the very least, being broken with each new\nrelease of Node, since none of these API surfaces are \"technically\"\n\"supported\" by the team managing the Node.js project.\n\nThis module does not ship a _copy_ of Node's internals.  It does its\nthing by using the exposed source code that lives in Node.js itself.\nSo, running this on different versions of Node.js will produce\ndifferent results.\n\nWhen your program is broken by changes to Node's internals, or when\nNode changes in such a way that this module becomes fundamentally\nbroken, you will likely get little sympathy.  Many people in the Node\ncommunity consider this sort of behavior to be unwise and unseemly, if\nnot outright hostile and morally wrong.\n\nAt the very least, you probably just want to run Node with the\n(undocumented!) `--expose-internals` flag, rather than go to such\nlengths.\n\nDon't use unless you know what you're doing, or at least, are ok with\nthe risks.  Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nEternally Yours in OSS,  \nIsaac Z. Schlueter\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\nvar natives = require('natives')\n\n// get the source code\nvar fsCode = natives.source('fs')\n\n// get a evaluated copy of the module\nvar fsCopy = natives.require('fs')\n\n// you can pass in a whitelist to NOT shim certain things\nvar fsCopyWithNativeStreams = natives.require('fs', ['stream'])\n\n// note that this is not the same as the \"real\" fs\nassert(fsCopy !== require('fs'))\n\n// but it does have all the same entries\nfsCopy.readFileSync(__filename, 'utf8') // etc\n```\n\n## Another Caveat\n\nYou can't use this to override `require(\"buffer\")` because everything\ndepends on `Buffer.isBuffer` working properly, so it's important for\nthat one to be given a pass.\n",
