The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\r\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\r\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TL; DR**\r\n\r\n* Bundles both [CommonJs](http://www.commonjs.org/specs/modules/1.0/) and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\r\n* Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\r\n* Dependencies are resolved during compilation reducing the runtime size.\r\n* Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. coffeescript to JavaScript, handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\r\n* Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nCheck out webpack's [documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=trdr) for quick Getting Started guide, in-depth usage,\r\ntutorials and resources.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nproject:\r\n`npm install webpack --save-dev`\r\n\r\nglobal:\r\n`npm install webpack -g`\r\nUsage\r\nhttps://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [`examples`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples) folder.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Plugins\r\n\r\nwebpack has a [rich plugin\r\ninterface](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html). Most of the features\r\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\r\n**flexible**.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nwebpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast\r\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\r\n\r\n## Loaders\r\n\r\nwebpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle\r\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\r\nloaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) using node.js.\r\n\r\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\r\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\r\n\r\nPlease see [Using Loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html) for more information.\r\n\r\n**basic**\r\n* [`json`](https://github.com/webpack/json-loader): Loads file as JSON\r\n* [`raw`](https://github.com/webpack/raw-loader): Loads raw content of a file (as utf-8)\r\n* [`val`](https://github.com/webpack/val-loader): Executes code as module and consider exports as JavaScript code\r\n* [`script`](https://github.com/webpack/script-loader): Executes a JavaScript file once in global context (like in script tag), requires are not parsed.\r\n\r\n**packaging**\r\n* [`file`](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader): Emits the file into the output folder and returns the (relative) url.\r\n* [`url`](https://github.com/webpack/url-loader): The url loader works like the file loader, but can return a Data Url if the file is smaller than a limit.\r\n* [`image`](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader): Compresses your images. Ideal to use together with `file` or `url`.\r\n* [`svgo-loader`](https://github.com/pozadi/svgo-loader): Compresses SVG images using [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) library\r\n* [`baggage`](https://github.com/deepsweet/baggage-loader): Automatically require any resources related to the required one\r\n* [`polymer-loader`](https://github.com/JonDum/polymer-loader): Process HTML & CSS with preprocessor of choice and `require()` Web Components like first-class modules.\r\n\r\n**dialects**\r\n* [`coffee`](https://github.com/webpack/coffee-loader): Loads coffee-script like JavaScript\r\n* [`babel`](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader): Turn ES6 code into vanilla ES5 using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel).\r\n* [`livescript`](https://github.com/appedemic/livescript-loader): Loads LiveScript like JavaScript\r\n* [`sweetjs`](https://github.com/jlongster/sweetjs-loader): Use sweetjs macros.\r\n* [`traceur`](https://github.com/jupl/traceur-loader): Use future JavaScript features with [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).\r\n* [`typescript`](https://github.com/andreypopp/typescript-loader): Loads TypeScript like JavaScript.\r\n\r\n**templating**\r\n* [`html`](https://github.com/webpack/html-loader): Exports HTML as string, require references to static resources.\r\n* [`jade`](https://github.com/webpack/jade-loader): Loads jade template and returns a function\r\n* [`handlebars`](https://github.com/altano/handlebars-loader): Loads handlebars template and returns a function\r\n* [`ractive`](https://github.com/rstacruz/ractive-loader): Pre-compiles Ractive templates for interactive DOM manipulation\r\n* [`markdown`](https://github.com/peerigon/markdown-loader): Compiles Markdown to HTML\r\n* [`ng-cache`](https://github.com/teux/ng-cache-loader): Puts HTML partials in the Angular's $templateCache\r\n\r\n**styling**\r\n* [`style`](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader): Add exports of a module as style to DOM\r\n* [`css`](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader): Loads css file with resolved imports and returns css code\r\n* [`cssnext`](https://github.com/cssnext/cssnext-loader): Loads and compiles a css file using [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/)\r\n* [`less`](https://github.com/webpack/less-loader): Loads and compiles a less file\r\n* [`sass`](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader): Loads and compiles a scss file\r\n* [`stylus`](https://github.com/shama/stylus-loader): Loads and compiles a stylus file\r\n\r\n**misc**\r\n* [`po`](https://github.com/dschissler/po-loader): Loads a PO gettext file and returns JSON\r\n* [`mocha`](https://github.com/webpack/mocha-loader): Do tests with mocha in browser or node.js\r\n* [`eslint`](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader): PreLoader for linting code using ESLint.\r\n* [`jshint`](https://github.com/webpack/jshint-loader): PreLoader for linting code.\r\n* [`jscs`](https://github.com/unindented/jscs-loader): PreLoader for style checking.\r\n* [`injectable`](https://github.com/jauco/webpack-injectable): Allow to inject dependencies into modules\r\n* [`transform`](https://github.com/webpack/transform-loader): Use browserify transforms as loader.\r\n\r\nFor the full list of loaders, see [list of loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html).\r\n\r\n## Module Format (AMD/CommonJS)\r\n\r\nwebpack supports **both** AMD and CommonJS module styles. It performs clever static\r\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\r\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Code Splitting\r\n\r\nwebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\r\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\r\n\r\n[Code Splitting documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)\r\n\r\n## Optimizations\r\n\r\nwebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\r\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\r\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\r\nthrough code splitting. It can also can make your code chunks **cache\r\nfriendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n[Optimization documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/optimization.html)\r\n\r\nwebpack optimizes in several ways. It also makes your chunks **cache-friendly** by using hashes.\r\n\r\n# A small example of what's possible\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n// webpack is a module bundler.\r\n// This means webpack takes modules with dependencies\r\n// and emits static assets representing those modules.\r\n\r\n// Dependencies can be written in CommonJs\r\nvar commonjs = require(\"./commonjs\");\r\n// or in AMD\r\ndefine([\"amd-module\", \"../file\"], function (amdModule, file) {\r\n\t// while previous constructs are sync,\r\n\t// this is async\r\n\trequire([\"big-module/big/file\"], function (big) {\r\n\t\t // For async dependencies, webpack splits\r\n\t\t // your application into multiple \"chunks\".\r\n\t\t // This part of your application is\r\n\t\t // loaded on demand (code-splitting).\r\n\t\tvar stuff = require(\"../my/stuff\");\r\n\t\t// \"../my/stuff\" is also loaded on-demand\r\n\t\t//  because it's in the callback function\r\n\t\t//  of the AMD require.\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire(\"coffee!./cup.coffee\");\r\n// \"Loaders\" are used to preprocess files.\r\n// They can be prefixed in the require call\r\n// or configured in the configuration.\r\nrequire(\"./cup\");\r\n// This does the same when you add \".coffee\" to the extensions\r\n// and configure the \"coffee\" loader for /\\.coffee$/\r\n\r\nfunction loadTemplate (name) {\r\n\treturn require(\"./templates/\" + name + \".jade\");\r\n\t// Many expressions are supported in require calls.\r\n\t// A clever parser extracts information and concludes\r\n\t// that everything in \"./templates\" that matches\r\n\t// /\\.jade$/ should be included in the bundle, as it\r\n\t// can be required.\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n// ...and you can combine everything.\r\nfunction loadTemplateAsync (name, callback) {\r\n\trequire([\"bundle?lazy!./templates/\" + name + \".jade\"],\r\n\t  function (templateBundle) {\r\n\t          templateBundle(callback);\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=documentation)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[changelog](https://webpack.github.io/docs/changelog.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nYou can run the Node tests with `npm test`.\r\n\r\nYou can run the browser tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd test/browsertests\r\nnode build\r\n```\r\n\r\nand open `tests.html` in the browser.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nMost of the time, if webpack is not working correctly for you it is a simple configuration issue.\r\n\r\nIf you are still having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post\r\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). Questions\r\nthat include your webpack.config.js and relevant files are more likely to receive responses.\r\n\r\nIf you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\r\n\r\nIf you create a loader or plugin, please consider open sourcing it, putting it\r\non NPM and following the `x-loader`, `x-plugin` convention.\r\n\r\nYou are also welcome to correct any spelling mistakes or any language issues.\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our gitter.im room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2015 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n\r\n## Thanks to\r\n\r\n(In chronological order)\r\n\r\n* @google for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/CodeSplitting) as webpack.\r\n* @medikoo for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webpack. Interestingly the [Code Splitting issue is still open](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) (thanks also to @Phoscur for the discussion).\r\n* @substack for [browserify](http://browserify.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @jrburke for [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), which is a similar project and source for many ideas.\r\n* @defunctzombie for the [browser-field spec](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901), which makes modules available for node.js, browserify and webpack.\r\n* Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...\r\n* @shama, @jhnns and @sokra for maintaining this project\r\n* Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...\r\n* Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sponsor\r\n\r\nThis is a free-time project. The time I invest in it fluctuates. If you use webpack for a serious task, and you'd like me to invest more time on it, please donate. This project increases your income/productivity too. It makes development and applications faster and it reduces the required bandwidth.\r\n\r\nI'm very thankful for every dollar.
