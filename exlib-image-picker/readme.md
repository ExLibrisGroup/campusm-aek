# AEK React Boilerplate

Please replace this file with useful information about your module.

## How to use this boilerplate

### Modifying Source code

Source code can be modified in the `/src` directory.

#### CSS
Anything at the root of the css directory `/src/css/[name].*` will be treated as an entry point for the AEK CSS buildtool. This will process the source code by transpiling any less `[name].less` and stylus `[name].styl`. The output of this, along with any `[name].css` files will be passed on to autoprefixer post processing (this adds vendor prefixes to css properties). In development, the result is supplemented with source mapping, in production, it is minified. The output file will be available at `[publicPath]/css/[name].css`

The boilerplate contains a default stylesheet that uses the aek-css framework to provide a number of css components. You can configure colours, etc in `/aek-css-config.styl`

#### JS
Anything at the root of the js directory `/src/js/[name].*` will be treated as an entry point for AEK webpack buildtool. This will process source code by transpiling any `[name].es6.js` or `[name].jsx` files with BabelJS, and any `*.coffee` files through CoffeeScript. The webpack buildtool can also process less,stylus and css as css modules which are injected into the document with a styl-loader. Again, source maps are applied and production assets are minified. The output file will be available at `[publicPath]/js/[name].js`

The boilerplate includes some basic `.jsx` code that demonstrates some of the available react components.

----------------

_note that [publicPath] will be `/public` in development but will be very different in production_

#### Screens
Everything at the root of the screens directory `/src/screens/*.ect` will be treated as an ECT template. The output from the ECT process will provide either raw HTML (for disconnected screens), or the Twig code that is sent to the server (for connected screens).

"Disconnected" screens are served locally. "Connected" screens can include twig server-side processing and are served via the CampusM servers. To "connect" a screen set a `connected:true` property in the `@configure` section in the screen code.

### Other Public assets
Other public assets such as images or fonts can be added to the `/public` directory

### Runserver Config
You can configure aspects of the local server in `/runserver.yaml` - this allows you to override, customise or add the menu options and other homescreen properties.
