# AEK CSS

The aim of this project is to provide a component driven CSS framework predominantly for use in the AEK.

The project is built on Semantic-UI.

The goal is to enable developers to easily build reliable css from simple configuration with a "convention over configuration" philosophy.

All components should be optional allowing the developer to build an optimal stylesheet including only the elements they need for a specific project.

Themes allow a developer to define a dynamic number of named color styles. There are a number of configurable options for a theme but all that is required is a single base colour from which all other colour variations are derived.
