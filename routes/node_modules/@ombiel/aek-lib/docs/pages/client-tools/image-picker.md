# ImagePicker

## constructor

```javascript
new ImagePicker(options:Object)
```

## options

name | description
-------|--------------
`width` | (optional) minimum width in pixels (defaults to 500)
`height` | (optional) minimun height in pixels (default to 500)
`format` | (optional) output format [`"jpg"` or `"png"`] <br/> (defaults to `"jpg"`)
`quality` | (optional) compression quality percentage for "jpg" format. <br/> This should parse an integer from the given string so `"50%"` or `"50.32"` or `"50"` would all be treated the same <br/> (defaults to `"80"`)
`camera` | (optional) specify which camera to use initially [`"front"` or `"back"`] <br/> (defaults to `"back"`)
`save` | (optional) save image to photo album [`"yes"` or `"no"`] <br/> (defaults to `"no"`)
`sizing` | (optional) sizing mode [`"cover"` or `"contain"` or `"usercrop"`] <br/> (defaults to `"contain"`) <br/> _see below for explanation_
`overlay` | (optional) specify an overlay image (url) to be overlayed over user cropping interface for user guidance


## sizing options

name | description
-------|--------------
`"cover"` | Scale the image to be as large as possible so that the target area is completely covered. The image should be centered in the target area and some parts of the image may need to be cropped evenly on each side.
`"contain"` | Scale the image to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the target area. Any excess pixels should be removed so that the resulting image might be smaller than the target dimension on one of the axis
`"usercrop"` | native interface providing user the ability to move and scale the image within the target area. The initial view of this should default to a centered crop as per `"cover"` option

## Example AEK implementation

``` javascript

import {ImagePicker} from "@ombiel/aek-lib";

const imagePicker = new ImagePicker({
  width:200,
  height:300,
  format:"jpg",
  quality:50,
  camera:"front",
  save:"yes",
  sizing:"cover",
  overlay:"http://myimage.com/silhouette.png"
});

imagePicker.on("complete",(data)=>{
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = `data:image/${data.format};base64,${data.imageData}`;
});

imagePicker.on("error",(message,details)=> {
  alert(message);
});

imagePicker.on("cancel",()=> {
  alert("You must choose an image");
}
