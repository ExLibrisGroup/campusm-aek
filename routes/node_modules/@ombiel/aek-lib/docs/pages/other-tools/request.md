## Request

Request is using SuperAgent as base. We believe that SuperAgent is a great light-weight ajax API. Due to the flexibility, readability and its ability to be easy to learn we believe that this is a great system to use.

To learn about the standard approaches for SuperAgent please look at the documentation below. We havent take our own copy of this as we know that SuperAgent could change over time and want to make sure the documentation you have access to is current.

We have created one additional method to be used within Request this is below.

To use request you will need to define this by requiring request at the top of your JSX file. Please use the following line

`import {request} from "@ombiel/aek-lib";`


--------------------

### `request.action(action: string, opts: ?Object)`

This allows you to request the current AEK screen with the specified action - it works as a drop in replacement for `superagent.post()`

#### `options`

Optional object to provide additional options

| option | description |
|-------------|------|
| `sso:boolean` | Set to true to ensure request is passed through SSO routes to ensure that SSO attributes are available in the target screen |


--------------------

### `request.screen(screen: string, opts: ?Object)`

This allows you to request another AEK screen - it works as a drop in replacement for `superagent.post()`

The `screen` argument should be in the form `"PACKAGE/SCREEN"` - eg `"my-package/my-target-screen"`

To target a screen in the same package, you can use a "." - eg `"./my-target-screen"`

#### `options`

Optional object to provide additional options

| option | description |
|-------------|------|
| `sso:boolean` | Set to true to ensure request is passed through SSO routes to ensure that SSO attributes are available in the target screen |
| `action:string` | An optional AEK action to send to the screen  |
