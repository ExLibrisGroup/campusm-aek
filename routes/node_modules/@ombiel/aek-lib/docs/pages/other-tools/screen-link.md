## Screen Link

This a simple function that allows you to provide links to other AEK screens. This allows you to have multiple AEK screens linking together to allow you to seperate your module out across multiple pages rather than having it all in one page and having subpages.

Below is a basic example of how screenLink works.

### Basic Usage

``` javascript

import {screenLink} from "@ombiel/aek-lib";

const url = screenLink("my-package/my-screen",{foo:"bar"});


```

#### `screenLink(screenPath: string, params: Object): string`
