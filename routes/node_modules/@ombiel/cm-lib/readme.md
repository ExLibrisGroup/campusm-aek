# AEK Lib

This package contains library code modules for use in developing client side code for AEK. These tools were developed by ExLibris and provide useful utilities and integration points for the AEK and the CampusM platform.

## AEK React

This package also includes a set of React components that have been explicitly designed to meet common goals of the AEK and integrate well with other libraries and aek-css framework. The use of React is optional but this forms part of our recommended technology stack.

## Client Tools

Our client tools provide integration points between your AEK code and the native host client allowing you to work with native features such as maps and camera functions

## Other

The package also contains other useful library code for common utilities such as ajax, routing, logging, etc.
